It’s time for our monthly Cadence Community Spotlight update with news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Knowledge Sharing and Support

Our Slack #support channel has been busy this month with 13 questions asked this month by 12 different community members. Six community members took time to respond to those questions which clearly shows our community is growing, collaborating and keen to share knowledge.

Please don’t forget that we encourage everyone to post questions on StackOverflow using the **cadence-workflow** and **uber-cadence** tags so that others with similar questions or issues can easily search for and find an answer.

## Improving Technical Office Hours

Over the last few months we have been holding regular monthly Office Hours meetings but they have not attracted as many participants as we would like. We would like to understand if there is something preventing people from attending (e.g perhaps the timing or dates are not convenient) so we are planning to send out a short community survey.

If you have any ideas or comments about how we can improve our community office hours sessions then please include this in your feedback or contact us in the #community Slack channel.

## Cadence Stability Improvements

Is Cadence getting better? Yes it is! Many of you may have noticed that Cadence is improving.That is because of the amount of work being done behind the scenes. The Cadence core team has been doing a lot of work to stabilise Cadence functionality. Keep watching out for even more improvements!
