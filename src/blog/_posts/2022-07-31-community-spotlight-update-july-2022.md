Here’s our monthly Community Spotlight update that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Flying Drones with Cadence

Community member [Paul Brebner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-brebner-0a547b4/) has released [another blog](https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/spinning-your-drones-with-cadence-and-apache-kafka-how-many-drones-can-we-fly/) in the series of using Cadence to manage a drone delivery service. You can see a [simulated view of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQeFSqzprk)

Don’t forget to try out the code yourself and remember if you have used Cadence to do something interesting then please let us know so we can feature it in our next update.

## GitHub Statistics

During July the main Cadence branch had 28 pull requests (PRs) merged. There were 214 files changed by 11 different authors. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/uber/cadence/pulse/monthly)

## Cadence Roadmap

The Cadence Core team has been busy this month looking at the various community feedback for potential improvements and features for Cadence. Planning is already in place for a development roadmap and  it is still a little too early to say what will be included so please watch out for future updates. All I know is that it’s going to be exciting!
