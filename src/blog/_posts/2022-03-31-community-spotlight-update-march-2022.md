Welcome to our Cadence Community Spotlight update!

This is the latest in our series of monthly blog posts focused on the Cadence community and news about what you have been doing with Cadence.

Please see below for a short activity roundup of what has happened recently in the community.

## Updated Cadence Topology Diagram

Did you know that we have an updated Cadence Service diagram on the website? Well we do - and you can find it on our [Deployment Topology](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/concepts/topology/#overview) page. We are always looking for information that helps makes it easier for people to understand how Cadence works.

Special thanks to Ben Slater for updating the diagram and also to Ender, Emrah and Long for helping review it.

## Monthly Cadence Technical Office Hours

Every month we hold a Technical Office Hours session via Zoom where you can speak directly with some of our Cadence experts. If you have a question about Cadence or are facing a particular issue getting it setup then please come along and chat  to one of our experts!

Meetings are held on the last Monday of every month so make sure you mark the dates in your calendars. Our next session will be on the 25th April at 9am PT so hope to see you there!

## Some Cadence Statistics

This month we thought it would be interesting to post some statistics about the Cadence community.

- 1722  -  the number of members in our #general Slack channel
- 24 - the number of questions asked in our #support Slack channel during the month
- 5 - the number of questions asked about Cadence in StackOverflow during the month
- 105 - the number of contributors to the Cadence git repo

## Using StackOverflow to Respond to Support Questions

We have over 1700 members in our #support channel on our Cadence Slack where some of you have been asking questions about Cadence. The community has been responding and provided some great answers that we don’t want to lose!

It can be difficult searching the Slack #support channel for a specific problem and we want to make sure that we capture all these great answers so that they can help others in the community.

So if possible we would like you to start posting your Cadence questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

- Create your question in StackOverflow
- Post the StackOverflow question link in the Cadence Slack #support channel
- A response to your question will be posted to StackOverflow

Other community members will be able to search StackOverflow for the details of the your question and see the response. We hope that this will make it easier for people to find answers to common questions.
