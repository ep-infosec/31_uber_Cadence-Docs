Please see below for a short activity roundup of what has happened recently in the community.

## SD Times Names Cadence Open Source Project of the Week

In April Cadence was named as open source project of the week by the SD Times. Being named gives the project some great publicity and means the project is getting noticed. You can find a link to the article in the *Cadence in the News* section below.
