# Concepts

Cadence is a new developer friendly way to develop distributed applications.

It borrows the core terminology from the workflow-automation space. So its concepts include [workflows](01-workflows/) and [activities](02-activities/). :workflow:Workflows: can react to [events](03-events/) and return internal state through [queries](04-queries/).

The [deployment topology](05-topology/) explains how all these concepts are mapped to deployable software components.
