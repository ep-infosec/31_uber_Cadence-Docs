# Event driven application

Many applications listen to multiple :event: sources, update the state of correspondent business entities,
and have to execute actions if some state is reached.
Cadence is a good fit for many of these. It has direct support for asynchronous :event:events: (aka :signal:signals:),
has a simple programming model that obscures a lot of complexity
around state persistence, and ensures external action execution through built-in retries.

Real-world examples:

* Fraud detection where :workflow: reacts to :event:events: generated by consumer behavior
* Customer loyalty program where the :workflow: accumulates reward points and applies them when requested
